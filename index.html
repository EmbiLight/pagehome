                  <div><strong><em>Incubation period</em></strong></div>
                  <div>This is when the <strong>virus</strong> is establishing itself. Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.
                    The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.

                  <div><strong><em>Mild disease</em></strong></div>
                  <div>
                    This is all most people will experience. Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed. These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever. However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <div><em><strong>Severe disease</strong></em></div>
                  <div>If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.
                    Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.
                    Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.
                    This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.

                  <div><em><strong>Critical disease</strong></em></div>
                  <div>
                    It is estimated around <strong>6%</strong> of cases become critically ill.By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.
                    The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.
                    It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.
                    This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.
                    But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.
